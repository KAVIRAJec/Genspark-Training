Create an Azure Board to manage your project’s work items and sprints.
Define and visualize your system’s architecture and flow using Class Diagram and Sequence Diagram.

Instructions
Part 1 – Azure Board Setup
Create or access your Azure DevOps organization
If you don’t have one, create a free account at https://dev.azure.com.
Create a new Project
Name your project appropriately (e.g., E-Commerce API, HR Management Portal).
