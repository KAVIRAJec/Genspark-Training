QUESTION:
You have been hired to build the backend for a Twitter-like application using .NET 8, Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with PostgreSQL as the database. 
The application supports basic social media features such as user registration, posting tweets, liking tweets, using hashtags, and following users.
Your goal is to model and implement the database layer only using EF Core with code-first approach, focusing on data design, relationships,  migrations, and PostgreSQL-specific features.
